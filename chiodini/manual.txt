Hints
=====

You can draw (and erase) chiodini with click and with click&drag.
You can't draw over old chiodini. You must erase it before.
This is useful when drawing because you can't accidentally overwrite old chiodini.

You can draw with arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
It works like a turtle draw.
i.e. Put a chiodino in the grid: this is the start point. Now draw chiodini using the arrows key.

The 'new' command wait for a confirm: you must press 'y' (new file) or 'n' (cancel).

You can change chiodini dimension only at beginning of new draw.

To select a color you must click over the rainbow palette or user palette or web safe palette colors.
The button 'pick' is useful when you want to pick a color from chiodini grid (you forgot which color palette you picked...).

The Zoom is useful when selecting color. Click on zoom window to enable/disable it.

When the 'erase' button switch off, it sets current tool as previous tool.
i.e. Draw, press 'e', erase, press 'e', draw.

The background image (backImage.jpg) should be proportional to grid window dimension.
i.e. 1200x600 or 1200x1000
You can't change background image at runtime.

Save file without extension. The save command writes two file:
1. a text file (as <name>)
2. an image file (as <name>.png)

The 'fill' command fills grid with current tool, but these chiodini are not saved in text file (only as image).

Don't draw over filled chiodini. They are not saved.
i.e. Press Fill, see the result, press Fill again to remove.

The 'load colors' button loads a text file (userPalette.txt) with 25 colors (one for row).
The colors must be in hexadecimal form (and must be 25).

The hex value of current color (at right below the web safe palette) begin with alpha value (FF).
