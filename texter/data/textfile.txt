At the time of writing the world is being engulfed by increasingly cataclysmic
manifestations of the disturbance and disruption of Nature's
otherwise orderly processes. From reports received almost daily,
both nationally and from around the world, we are increasingly forced to
become aware of certain life-threatening irregularities in the functioning of
Nature's household. Record catastrophes of increasing violence and extent
are being reported in almost every country; tornadoes, deluges, widespread
flooding, searing drought, earthquakes, unseasonable snowfalls and
extremes of temperature, all of which are associated with huge loss and suffering.
Strife and starvation are on the increase, coupled with a seemingly
endless emergence of hitherto unheard of diseases. The majority of these
existence-threatening events, these so-called 'natural disasters', are not of
Nature's making. On the contrary, they are directly attributable to the misdemeanours
of humanity, the result of its arrogant repudiation or even total
ignorance of Nature's sublime laws and the subtle interactions between the
all-permeating interdependencies upon which all life is founded.
